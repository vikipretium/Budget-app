# Budget-app
The Ruby on Rails capstone project is about building a mobile web application where you can manage your budget: you have a list of transactions associated with a category, so that you can see how much money you spent and on what.  You will create a Ruby on Rails application that allows the user to:  register and log in, so that the data is private to them. introduce new transactions associated with a category. see the money spent on each category.
